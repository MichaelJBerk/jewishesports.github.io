<h1>Welcome to the NHEI website</h1>
<p>The NHEI or Nation Hillel Esports Initiative is a group of college students across the country trying to unify segments of the Jewish world over a shared love for video games.</p>
<p>In addition, we hope to foster a strong Jewish Esports Presence, both through grassroots local events and through National competitions hosted by colleges across the US.</p>
